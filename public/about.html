<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am Mario Ces√©n, a mechatronics engineer passionate about technological innovation. My education has allowed me to develop skills in programming, 3D design, electronic circuits, IoT, and automation. During my studies, I focused on projects that combine hardware and software development, highlighting my thesis work, where I designed a monitoring and control system for a 3D printer using MariaDB. My interest in education and technology led me to create an educational kit for young people aged 15 to 18, aiming to promote learning about 3D printing through the STEM methodology.</p>


<p>My experience includes an internship in the construction project of the army air base at Mariscal Sucre Airport, where I applied my knowledge in a real-world setting. This challenge, along with the academic demands of my thesis and a parallel project, strengthened my ability to manage multiple tasks and solve complex problems. I am motivated to take on new challenges that involve developing technological solutions applied to industry and education.</p>


<p>In the future, I aspire to contribute to the technological development of Ecuadorian industry by creating tools and systems that modernize production processes. I am open to working in companies that allow me to continue growing professionally and applying my experience in IoT, automation, and databases. My goal is to keep learning and evolving in the field of engineering, always seeking efficient and innovative solutions.
